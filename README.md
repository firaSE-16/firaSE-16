Firaol Ayana
Full-Stack Developer | Software Architecture Enthusiast

I am a software developer dedicated to building scalable, efficient, and well-designed systems. With experience in React, Node.js, Flutter, and MongoDB, I create seamless web and mobile applications that solve real-world problems. My passion for software architecture drives me to write clean, maintainable code and design robust solutions.

What I Do
Full-Stack Development: Building applications with React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Express.

Mobile App Development: Creating cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter for a native-like user experience.

System Architecture: Designing scalable and high-performance systems based on industry best practices.

Problem Solving: Using tools like Zod, Vite, and Render to overcome complex development challenges.

Collaboration
I am always open to collaborating with creative and innovative teams on ambitious projects. Whether it's a healthcare platform like MediConnect or a new startup idea, I am ready to contribute my skills to build systems that make an impact.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy sketching system diagrams and exploring the latest trends in microservices and cloud architecture. Let’s build the future together.
